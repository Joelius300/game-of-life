# game of life
A small console application which simulates [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It was for school and contains my (as far as I remember) first unit tests written in java. Parts of the code are randomly commented out and the rest I wouldn't call good code either.

### Usage: ###
~~~shell
$ java -jar GameOfLife.jar HEIGHT(int) WIDTH(int) STARTPERCENT(float) [INTERVAL (in ms)]
~~~
